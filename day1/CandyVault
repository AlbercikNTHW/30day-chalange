🍬 Challenge: CandyVault (HTB - Retired)
Category: Web Difficulty: Easy Vulnerability: NoSQL Injection (MongoDB)

📖 Description
CandyVault is a retired web challenge on Hack The Box that introduces users to a classic NoSQL Injection scenario in a MongoDB-based login system. The objective is to bypass authentication and retrieve the hidden flag.

🔍 Technical Overview
The application implements a login page where users are expected to enter an email and password. However, improper input sanitization and the usage of MongoDB’s find_one() method introduce a vulnerability.

The backend likely includes code similar to:


user = users.find_one({ "email": email, "password": password })

Because user input is inserted directly into the query without validation, it's possible to manipulate the query structure.

🧪 Exploitation Strategy
By sending a specially crafted JSON payload, we can bypass authentication using logical operators like $ne (not equal). Example payload:


{
  "email": { "$ne": null },
  "password": { "$ne": null }
}

Important: The Content-Type header must be set to application/json, or the server will treat values as strings rather than objects.

✅ Result
On successful exploitation, the login bypasses and redirects to a flag page—completing the challenge.
